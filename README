   to an optimal protein identification, namely sequence variations and PTMs.

   Important note: if you want to download a FASTA version of the human protein
   sequences in neXtProt you can use the PEFF format file and ignore the extra 
   information on the ">" line. You should also take note that the sequences in
   neXtProt are 100% identical to those in UniProtKB/Swiss-Prot and that if you 
   want to download sequence information to implement of sequence search engine
   you should do so using the UniProt server FTP site available at:
