** DETAILED CONTENT DESCRIPTION **

HPP_entries_with_nacetyl_by_chromosome.txt

File listing the chromosome and accession numbers for each entry with an annotated 
N-acetylated residue. An entry is considered N-acetylated if it has GOLD experimental
evidence for a modified-residue annotation to a posttranslational modification (PTM) 
term name starting with the motif "N*acetyl" (where * corresponds to 0-n characters).

HPP_entries_with_phospho_by_chromosome.txt

File listing the chromosome and accession numbers for each entry with an annotated 
phosphorylated residue. An entry is considered phosphorylated if it has GOLD experimental
evidence for a modified-residue annotation to a posttranslational modification (PTM) 
term name starting with the motif "Phospho".
